## âœ¨ Why This Matters

This release marks a shift from traditional monolithic RAG stacks to a **fully composable, testable, and CI-validated** toolkit. It was built with long-term developer experience (DX) in mind, emphasizing:

- ðŸ“¦ **Modularity**: Swap or add plugins without rewriting pipeline logic
- ðŸ§ª **Test Confidence**: Never publish broken mocks or CI regressions again
- ðŸ§  **Scalability**: Suitable for both small prototypes and production pipelines
- ðŸ›  **Tooling First**: Includes everything from config loading to evaluation dashboards

---

## ðŸ“¦ Install Now

```bash
npm install @devilsdev/rag-pipeline-utils
```

ðŸ§  Built for engineers who want **control, clarity, and composability** in their LLM workflows.
