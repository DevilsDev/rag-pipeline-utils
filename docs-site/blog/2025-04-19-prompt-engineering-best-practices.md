Prompt engineering is a critical lever in maximizing the effectiveness of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. In this article, we explore:

## Prompting in Modular RAG Pipelines

Your `rag-pipeline-utils` system allows swappable LLM backends and encourages prompt templates as part of the reranker or query orchestrator.

- Always define clear input/output expectations
- Leverage JSON or YAML-based structured prompts where applicable
- Evaluate with real examples using the CLI + evaluation framework

## What to Include in Prompts

- **Context injection**: retrieved chunks, metadata, source provenance
- **Task framing**: instruction-oriented for LLM consistency
- **Scoring heuristics**: if doing ranking, consider scoring guidelines

## Prompt as Plugin (Future Feature)

Eventually, we plan to support `promptTemplate` as a plugin type â€“ enabling reusable prompt logic alongside `loader`, `retriever`, etc.
