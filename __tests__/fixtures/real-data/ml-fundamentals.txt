        Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on 
        algorithms that can learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly 
        programmed for every scenario.
        
        ## Key Concepts
        
        1. **Supervised Learning**: Learning with labeled examples
        2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
        3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through interaction and feedback
        
        ## Applications
        
        - Natural Language Processing
        - Computer Vision
        - Recommendation Systems
        - Autonomous Vehicles
