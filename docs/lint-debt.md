# ESLint Technical Debt Tracking

This document tracks temporary ESLint rule disables that require future resolution.

## Guidelines

- Each disable must have a clear rationale and owner
- All disables should have target resolution dates
- Prefer fixing the underlying issue over disabling rules
- Document any API constraints that prevent immediate fixes

## Current Technical Debt

_No temporary disables currently tracked - all issues should be resolved properly._

## Resolved Items

_Items will be moved here once the underlying issues are fixed._
